- First of all thanks for the great task.
- I didn't use any third-party packages intentionally because I didn't know if I could use them in the task or not.
  not because I prefer not using them
- I've changed the close button place becuase i want to use the built-in Image component and render the image with its real ratio

# Sakneen Front End Task

:wave: This is a NextJS React app interview challenge. Please fork this repo, and push your code to a branch in your forked repo (following the instructions below).

In this exercise you will be implementing a new page that will have a table displaying a bunch of units (apartments, villas...). The design can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/SYWCrd5A18H44UoxJBfUW2/Frontend-task?node-id=0%3A1) You might need to sign up to be able to inspect the figma design

Note, it's not required to implement all these features, but implement what you can, Also, do the best you can for file structure and code best practices, Good Luck.

## Requirements

- Create a page that **mimics** the given design in terms of style.
- The table **must support** pagination and sorting functionalities
- The table **must support** searching by unit id functionally
- Clicking on the image in the gallery column should open a **light box** viewing all the images for that unit
- Add some unit test cases as you can.
- Let your imagination make the design of task responsive.

## Notes

- The `API` used for fetching the data is `http://localhost:3005/listings`
- Feel free to add any cool tricks showing off your skills (testing, caching, SEO, re-rendering optimizations...).
- If anything is ambiguous or not clear, update the `README.MD` file with your assumptions
- The total number of records returned from the API is **50**
- we use the [json server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) spec.
