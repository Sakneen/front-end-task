# Sakneen Front End Task

## (1) Deployment:

- To make the Task work Live, I have deployed the dbjson server to vercel as well.
- If you want to still run the project Locally, I have left the .env files in the repo to make things easier.
- Task Link: https://front-end-task-p3y9pztlt-mohammed-hossam.vercel.app/

## (2) Assumptions

- #### Design:

  I tried to be tied to the design.

- #### responsiveness:

  for photos Modal, I make the arrows top and bottom, and for filter and sort features, I make them as column instead of row.

- #### filter and sort:
  I assumed that they should be done on the server, as I saw query params for them.

## (3) Used Tools:

- #### Material UI:
  I am more used to pure CSS, but I decided to use material UI, as I have used it before and saw that the components in the design are very similar to that in material UI.
- #### React Query:
  I used react query before with React.js, but not with Next.js, so I decided to try how it will work with the SSR features in Next.js .
- #### Cypress:
  to make some tests.
